# 👋Introduction

Hi, I'm Jonathan — a recent NUS Computer Science graduate with 16 months of full-stack experience in healthtech and research. I'm now focused on cloud infrastructure and security, building secure cloud-native applications with AWS. Passionate about DevSecOps, automation, and occasionally popping reverse shells in my free time.
